                        R-Type Protocol

Abstract

    This document describes the R-Type Protocol, a network protocol
    between clients and the server for the game engine of R-Type.
    The protocol allows the connection of a player, the sending of
    inputs, the creation and movement of entities such as mobs or
    missiles but also information about the current game.

RFC 8701                R-Type Protocol                       Jan 2020

    1.  Introduction

        The R-Type Protocol provides information about the
        communication between clients and the R-Type game's server.
        The game use a UDP protocol for the communication.

    2.  Standard Communication

        The server uses a package system containing
        a sequence of bytes organized as follows:

        +--------+  +----------------------+  +-----------+
        |  TYPE  |  |  NUMBER OF ELEMENTS  |  |  ELEMENT  |
        | (ENUM) |  |        (int)         |  |  (objet)  |
        +--------+  +----------------------+  +-----------+

        The server uses an instruction list (with an ENUM)
        to communicate with the server.

        +------------------------+
        |  "PACKET_PLAYER_NEW"   |
        |  "PACKET_PLAYER_MOVE"  |
        |  "PACKET_PLAYER"       |
        |  "PACKET_ENTITY"       |
        |  "PACKET_END"          |
        +------------------------+

        A packet MUST always end with an ENUM
        of type "PACKET_END" to indicate the end.

    3.  Client Connection

        To connect to a server you MUST send a packet
        of type "PACKET_PLAYER_NEW" followed by
        the client port and the end of packet
        indication (with "PACKET_END").

        Once the client is connected the server will instantly send data
        on the entities to be displayed. It is RECOMMENDED to configure
        a timeout of two seconds maximum to wait for
        the server's response and handle connection errors.

    4.  Receiving Data

        When the connection to the server is made the server will
        send the entity and player information 25 times per second.
        The information is sent in a package containing information
        about the players and entities (enemies and shots).

        For the players the list is sent in the following format:

        - PACKET_PLAYER (enum)
        - number of elements (int)
        - element(s)
            - player id (int)
            - position X (int)
            - position Y (int)

        For entities the list is sent in the following format:

        - PACKET_ENTITY (enum)
        - number of elements (int)
        - element(s)
            - entity type (int)
            - entity id (int)
            - position X (int)
            - position Y (int)

        A packet MUST always end with a "PACKET_END".

    5.  Player Movement

        In order for the player to send his moves,
        a packet MUST be sent with the player's direction.
        To send the player's move you MUST to start the
        packet with the instruction "PACKET_PLAYER_MOVE"
        and then the desired direction.

        The package SHOULD look like this:

        - PACKET_PLAYER_MOVE (enum)
        - movement (int)
        - PACKET_END (enum)

        For movements, 0 corresponds to upward movement,
        1 to the right, 2 to the bottom and 3 to the left.
