                        R-Type Protocol

Abstract

    This document describes the R-Type Protocol, a network protocol
    between clients and the server for the game engine of R-Type.
    The protocol allows the connection of a player, the sending of
    inputs, the creation and movement of entities such as mobs or
    missiles but also information about the current game.

RFC 8701                R-Type Protocol                       Jan 2020

    1.  Introduction

        The R-Type Protocol provides information about the
        communication between clients and the R-Type game's server.
        The game use a UDP protocol for the communication.

    2.  Standard Communication

        The server uses a package system containing
        a sequence of bytes organized as follows:

        +--------+  +----------------------+  +-----------+
        |  TYPE  |  |  NUMBER OF ELEMENTS  |  |  ELEMENT  |
        | (ENUM) |  |        (int)         |  |  (objet)  |
        +--------+  +----------------------+  +-----------+

        The server uses an instruction list (with an ENUM)
        to communicate with the server.

        +------------------------+
        |  "PACKET_PLAYER_NEW"   |
        |  "PACKET_PLAYER_MOVE"  |
        |  "PACKET_PLAYER"       |
        |  "PACKET_ENTITY"       |
        |  "PACKET_END"          |
        +------------------------+

        A packet MUST always end with an ENUM
        of type "PACKET_END" to indicate the end.

    3.  Client Connection

        To connect to a server you MUST send a packet
        of type "PACKET_PLAYER_NEW" followed by
        the port and the end of packet indication (with "PACKET_END").

        Once the client is connected the server will instantly send data
        on the entities to be displayed. It is RECOMMENDED to configure
        a timeout of two seconds maximum to wait for
        the server's response and handle connection errors.
